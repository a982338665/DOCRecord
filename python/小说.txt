It's not really clear what you are trying to do here. flashcard_list is an (empty) list, which you define before your loop. It doesn't make sense to call Django queryset functions like count and filter on it (there is a list method named count, but as the error says, it takes an argument, and counts the number of times that argument is found in the list).Did you mean to use flashcard.count() instead? That still doesn't make sense, because flashcard is a single Flashcard instance, not a queryset. You'll need to explain a bit more exactly what you're hoping to do.Here you can see that you're operating on the queryset of all flashcards, rather than an empty list. And you're building up a single dictionary, not a list of dictionaries, and that dictionary itself becomes the template context - so in the template you can reference {{ words_count }} etc.
